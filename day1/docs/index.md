## 🌟 Welcome to the Sign Language Recognition Project

This innovative capstone project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to bridge communication gaps by recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time. Designed with accessibility in mind, it transforms hand gestures into readable text, facilitating seamless interaction between the deaf and hearing communities.

### 🔄 How It Works

📷 **Capture Gesture** → 🧠 **Process with CNN** → 🖥️ **Display Predicted Sign**

Utilizing a webcam or uploaded image, the system identifies the sign and presents the corresponding label instantly.
