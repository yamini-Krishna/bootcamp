Welcome to the official documentation for the Figure Caption Extraction and Access System.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

This system extracts, stores, and serves key metadata from scientific publications, including:

- Title
- Abstract
- Figure captions (list)
- URLs for figures (if any)
- Key entities (e.g., genes) mentioned in figure captions

The initial focus is on PubMed Central (PMC) articles, but the architecture supports future expansion to other sources.
