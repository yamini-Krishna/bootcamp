# Final Project Reflection

## 1. Design Decisions

The key architectural choice in this project was the use of a **stream-based pipeline** for processing files. This abstraction allowed us to model the system as a series of steps, where each step is responsible for transforming or routing the file. This design choice made it easier to scale and modify the processing pipeline as the project evolved.

Another important design decision was to support both **Single File Mode** and **Watch Mode**. This provided flexibility for both immediate file processing and continuous monitoring, catering to different use cases and user preferences.

## 2. Tradeoffs

One of the key tradeoffs in this project was **simplicity versus flexibility**. To keep things simple, I omitted certain features like complex error handling or file versioning. These features could be beneficial in a real-world scenario but were simplified in this project for clarity and ease of implementation. Additionally, the system does not support advanced features like file prioritization or complex file transformation chains, which would be necessary for larger-scale use.

The main limitation of the system is its inability to handle large volumes of data efficiently. While it works well with a moderate number of files, performance could degrade when the input grows significantly.

## 3. Scalability

If the input size increased by 100x, several changes would need to be made. First, the system would need **parallelization** for file processing. This could be achieved by using a task queue and worker nodes, where each worker processes files concurrently. However, care would need to be taken to ensure **safe parallelism**, especially when handling shared resources like logs or statistics.

Additionally, scaling the system would require more efficient **file routing** and **state management** to ensure that files are processed in the right order without redundancy or missing files.

## 4. Extensibility & Security

For real-world use, this system would need additional features for **security** and **extensibility**:
- **File Upload Security**: We would need to implement additional measures to prevent malicious file uploads, such as validating file types and scanning for viruses.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Since this is a web-based system, implementing authentication to control access to the dashboard and endpoints would be important.
- **Error Handling and Monitoring**: More comprehensive error handling (e.g., retry mechanisms for failed processing) and monitoring (e.g., log aggregation) would be crucial for a production environment.

To secure the output data, it would be necessary to ensure that all sensitive information is encrypted, both at rest and in transit, and that users have appropriate permissions to access only their own data.
