        "abstract": "ObjectiveShort-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) early in the course of type 2 diabetes acutely improves beta-cell function with long-lasting effects on glycemic control. However, conventional measures cannot determine which patients are better suited for IIT, and little is known about the molecular mechanisms determining response. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict the response to IIT and provide insight into molecular mechanisms driving such response in humans.MethodsTwenty-four patients with early type 2 diabetes were assessed at baseline and four weeks after IIT, consisting of basal detemir and premeal insulin aspart. Twelve individuals had a beneficial beta-cell response to IIT (responders) and 12 did not (nonresponders). Beta-cell function was assessed by multiple methods, including Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were profiled in plasma samples before and after IIT. The response to IIT was modeled using a machine learning algorithm and potential miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms assessed by differential expression, correlation, and functional network analyses (FNA).ResultsBaseline levels of circulating miR-145-5p, miR-29c-3p, and HbA1c accurately (91.7%) predicted the response to IIT (OR = 121 [95% CI: 6.7, 2188.3]). Mechanistically, a previously described regulatory loop between miR-145-5p and miR-483-3p/5p, which controls TP53-mediated apoptosis, appears to also occur in our study population of humans with early type 2 diabetes. In addition, significant (fold change > 2, P < 0.05) longitudinal changes due to IIT in the circulating levels of miR-138-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-320b, and let-7a-5p further characterized the responder group and significantly correlated (|r| > 0.4, P < 0.05) with the changes in measures of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. FNA identified a network of coordinately/cooperatively regulated miRNA-targeted genes that potentially drives the IIT response through negative regulation of apoptotic processes that underlie beta cell dysfunction and concomitant positive regulation of proliferation.ConclusionsResponses to IIT in people with early type 2 diabetes are associated with characteristic miRNA signatures. This study represents a first step to identify potential responders to IIT (a current limitation in the field) and provides important insight into the pathophysiologic determinants of the reversibility of beta-cell dysfunction.ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01270789.",

        "abstract": "Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV)1,2,3,4,5, but concerns remain over the possibility of future recurrences. Finding a vaccine for this virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that generate protective immunity in an animal model.Supplementary informationThe online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature02463) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

Symbols indicate the response of each individual animal, and the median value is shown (horizontal bar). b, Antibody responses induced by plasmid DNA vaccination against the SARS-CoV S protein. End-point dilution ELISA titres of SARS-CoV S-specific antibodies (left panel) in serum of vaccinated animals collected 10 days after the final boost were determined by optical density as described in the Methods. Neutralization by antisera from mice immunized with the relevant SARS-CoV S mutant or no insert (control) plasmid DNA vectors at the indicated concentrations was measured using the luciferase assay with S pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (middle panel). Reduction of gene transfer was observed with immune sera in a dose-dependent fashion. Twofold dilutions of heat-inactivated sera were tested in a microneutralization assay for the presence of antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV in Vero cell monolayers, using four wells per dilution on a 96-well plate (right panel). The presence of viral cytopathic effect (cpe) was read on days 3 and 4. The dilution of serum that completely prevented cpe in 50% of the wells was calculated by the Reed Muench formula. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e. for each group. A non-parametric two-tailed t-test (Mann–Whitney) was used for statistical analysis, and the relevant P values are indicated (b, right panel).",

Each naive mouse (n = 4) received 3 × 107 purified T cells from a donor mouse confirmed to respond to the vaccine (immune) or from a non-immune mouse (control). The recipient mice were challenged 24 h after adoptive T-cell transfer. Viral titre in lungs was measured as described in Fig. 3. There was no statistically significant difference between these two groups using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney two-tailed t-test (P = 0.49). c, Protection against SARS-CoV replication in the lungs after passive transfer of immune IgG from vaccinated mice. Purified IgG from SΔCD or control vaccinated donor mice (n = 4) was passively transferred into recipient naive mice (n = 4). Serum from recipient mice was collected one day before challenge, and neutralization was confirmed using the S pseudotyped lentiviral vector (left panel). Recipient mice (n = 4 per group) were challenged 24 h after IgG transfer with 104 TCID50 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication was measured as described in Fig. 3.

Apparent specific volume data were obtained with the lipids DOPC, POPC and DMPC at T = 30 °C, DPPC at 50 °C, and brain sphingomyelin (BSM) at 45 and 24 °C for mole fractions of cholesterol x from 0 to 0.5. Unlike previous cholesterol mixture studies, we converted our raw data to partial molecular volume VL of the lipid and VC of the cholesterol. The partial molecular volumes were constant for POPC and DOPC as x was varied, but had sharp breaks for the other lipids at values of xC near 0.25 ± 0.05. Results for x < xC clearly exhibit the condensation effect of cholesterol on DPPC, DMPC and BSM when measured at temperatures above their main transition temperatures TM. The break points at xC are compared to phase diagrams in the literature. For x > xC the values of the partial molecular volumes of cholesterol clustered near 630 ± 10 Å3 in all the lipids when measured for T > TM; we suggest that this is the most appropriate measure of the bare volume of cholesterol in lipid bilayers.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundSetting the dry weight and maintaining fluid balance is still a difficult challenge in dialysis patients. Overhydration is common and associated with increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with volume overload in end-stage renal dysfunction patients. Thus, monitoring pulmonary pressure by a CardioMEMS device could potentially be of guidance to physicians in the difficult task of assessing fluid overload in hemodialysis patients.Case presentation61-year old male with known congestive heart failure deteriorated over 3 months’ time from a state with congestive heart failure and diuresis to a state of chronic kidney disease and anuria. He began a thrice/week in-hospital hemodialysis regime. As he already had implanted a CardioMEMS device due to his heart condition, we were able to monitor invasive pulmonary artery pressure during the course of dialysis sessions. To compare, we estimated overhydration by both bioimpedance and clinical assessment. Pulmonary artery pressure correlated closely with fluid drainage during dialysis and inter-dialytic weight gain. The patient reached prescribed dry weight but remained pulmonary hypertensive by definition. During two episodes of intradialytic systemic hypotension, the patient still had pulmonary hypertension by current definition.ConclusionThis case report observes a close correlation between pulmonary artery pressure and fluid overload in a limited amount of observations. In this case we found pulmonary artery pressure to be more sensitive towards fluid overload than bioimpedance. The patient remained pulmonary hypertensive both as he reached prescribed dry weight and experienced intradialytic hypotensive symptoms. Monitoring pulmonary artery pressure via CardioMEMS could hold great potential as a real-time guidance for fluid balance during hemodialysis, though adjusted cut-off values for pulmonary pressure for anuric patients may be needed. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this case report and the applicability of pulmonary pressure in assessing optimal fluid balance.",
