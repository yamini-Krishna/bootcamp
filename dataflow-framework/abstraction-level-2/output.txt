ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) IS TRANSFORMING THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE BY ENABLING ADVANCEMENTS IN DIAGNOSTICS, TREATMENT, AND RESEARCH. IN MEDICINE, AI ALGORITHMS ARE CAPABLE OF ANALYZING MEDICAL DATA SUCH AS IMAGES, GENETIC SEQUENCES, AND PATIENT RECORDS, PROVIDING INSIGHTS THAT CAN ASSIST HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN MAKING MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSES AND PERSONALIZED TREATMENT PLANS.
